If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough.

For scraping the above table, you can simply use pandas to read the table into a pandas dataframe. Another way, which would help to learn for more complicated cases of web scraping is using the BeautifulSoup package. Here is the package's main documentation page: http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Use pandas, or the BeautifulSoup package, or any other way you are comfortable with to transform the data in the table on the Wikipedia page into the above pandas dataframe."
