These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table. If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. Clean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making. In the last cell of your notebook, use the .shape method to print the number of rows of your dataframe.\n",

For scraping the above table, you can simply use pandas to read the table into a pandas dataframe. Another way, which would help to learn for more complicated cases of web scraping is using the BeautifulSoup package. Here is the package's main documentation page: http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Use pandas, or the BeautifulSoup package, or any other way you are comfortable with to transform the data in the table on the Wikipedia page into the above pandas dataframe."
